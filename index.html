                                    Concept</h1>
                                    <p> In today's fast paced and ever-changing world it is hard to keep up with and handle our emotions. On top of this, the internet can be a very negative and aggressive place to be sometimes, which can negatively affect people's mental health. With the COVID-19 pandemic also affecting society and our mental health levels, we need to check up on our mental wellbeing now, more than ever. I wanted to create a space where the internet could be used in a positive way and a be beneficial environment for our wellbeing. My aim was to create an online safe-haven where people could visit to feel calm, relaxed and feel like they are emotionally understood. I wanted to create a website where people could breathe and become more in touch with their inner selves, unwind and find some peace. 
                                        Originally, I thought about various concepts which involved making a website where users could create digital art, however I think this Idea has been done multiple times and art is not the only form of stress relief I wanted to include and target. I wanted to target full sensory involvement by including elements such as exercise and music.

                                    <p>
This is where the Idea for 'Mood Matcher' was born. Mood matcher is  a website where users can find a space that will accommodate whatever mood they're in and show them interesting and relaxing content that will be defined by the tone of their mood. This is a mock up home page:

<div class= 'intent'id='intent'>

The intent of the 'Mood Matcher' will be explained at the top of the website. This will be portrayed in a swipe across box:

                                    <p>The website will have a <a href="https://windsorhealth.co.nz/products/moodrings?variant=29923883057197&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&gclid=Cj0KCQjwg8n5BRCdARIsALxKb97XOJkGGj0HsIWd0JFkHxWJK2Z2K6fFk0WLQ_DND22_Ufb0a-ubUWMaAo1oEALw_wcB"> link</a> to order a mood ring from. Once the user's mood ring arrives, they will put it on and it will show them their mood. If users are confident they know what their mood is, the website can also be used without the purchase of a ring. I chose Natural Windsor Health to order the ring from. Any mood ring would work for the website, however this is the one I selected and will recommend through the website for purchase, due to it being a New Zealand business and very affordable. The ring also arrived very quickly after it ordered it (within 1-2 working days) and it came in very aesthetically pleasing packaging. I already had a couple of mood rings before this but I needed to buy one that I could recommend through the website as well as review the purchasing process and the ring itself.

                                    <p> Users can then go onto the Mood Matcher website and select a link that matches whatever their mood shows, for example green for peaceful, or yellow for nervous and so on. Once they select this link they will be taken to a page that shows them songs and mixed media that accommodates their mood. This is an example of what may come up for 'Black: Stressed'. By clicking one of these circles the user will be re-directed to the selected<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqUdI4AIDF0"> song</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eed-40vnCpo"> mixed media</a>. This content would be updated monthly based on what users of the website suggest, as well as updated research. I chose this content based off asking those around me what they found helped when they were stressed, as well as going off my own experience.

                                    <p>The visual direction for mood matcher is to have a professional and clean aesthetic, while also conveying a relaxed and calming tone. I will keep the style very minimalistic due to this website being aimed at being a calming stress relief and online safe-haven. I want it to be as simple as possible while still serving its function, as to not overwhelm people when they visit the site. In contrast to many websites that have pop ups and unnecessary components which can overwhelm users. It will be approachable, friendly and make the user feel like they are in a safe and positive place. The colour palette will match the colours of the mood ring so that users can visually connect their mood with the colours. Visual aesthetics will be focused on throughout the website with typography not being a key focus. However I will be using  <a href="https://www.dafontfree.io/camaro-sans-serif-font/"> Camaro Sans</a> for headings, and <a href="https://www.download-free-fonts.com/details/92774/arial-rounded-mt-bold"> Arial Rounded MT Bold</a> </a> for body text. The general aesthetic of the website will be organic and curved.
